## My process

My process is always start with figuring out my divisions and then move into the CSS styling from top to bottom. I have also started to create CSS variables based on the style guide.  

### Built with

- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a fun challenge and I am getting faster at completing them. I got more practice using flexbox and CSS variables. 


### Continued development

So I'm not happy with the center position... I know there is a better way to do it, but since I am still new to Web design, I am pulling a few thngs together to achieve the desired result.
